## 👨‍💻 About Me

As a DevOps Engineer at Wipro, I design and maintain efficient CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub Actions, enabling seamless automated deployments across multiple environments. By implementing Infrastructure as Code with Terraform on AWS, I have reduced manual resource provisioning by 80%, improving speed, consistency, and operational excellence. I bring advanced expertise in Terraform and Jenkins (JCasC), along with strong skills in Datadog monitoring that optimize trace correlation and have cut issue resolution time by 30%. I am now AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03) and also HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003), strengthening my ability to design, automate, and operate reliable cloud-native platforms.
